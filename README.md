## Evolutionary Genomic Architecture Database 

EGAD is an analytical database designed to integrate multi-omics, timeseries datasets. It is built in postgreSQL. The database is currently in development and not yet ready for public use. This repo currently hosts the documentation and supporting scripts for the database, but the SQL file and full design are not yet released. Check back soon!

For an introduction to the database, see: Intro_to_Dev_DB.pdf.
